## Project Overview

Human Anatomy Exploration is an interactive single-page application (SPA) designed to offer an engaging educational experience centered around human anatomy. Leveraging the power of Three.js, this application provides an intuitive interface for exploring various parts of the human skeleton.

### Key Features

- **Interactive 3D Skeleton**: The left side of the interface displays a fully rotatable and zoomable 3D model of the human skeleton.
  
- **Detailed Body Part View**: Clicking on any specific body part in the skeleton triggers a detailed, zoomed-in view on the right side, along with the name of the selected part.

- **Clear Selection**: A "Clear" button allows users to easily deselect the current body part and return to the full skeleton view.

- **Reset View**: The "Reset View" button restores the original zoom and rotation, offering a quick way to reset the model.

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **3D Rendering**: Three.js
- **State Management**: Context API
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS

### Deployment

This project is deployed and can be accessed at [Human Anatomy Exploration](https://humananatomyexploration.onrender.com/).

### Future Enhancements

- **Muscle and Organ Integration**: Expanding the application to include muscles, internal organs, and other anatomical features.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Adding finger-point selection for an immersive experience in science centers.
